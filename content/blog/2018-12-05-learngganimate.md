  ## Who we are
  
  The [3rd rOpenSci OzUnconf](http://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/) was held in Melbourne from 22-23 November 2018 bringing together over 50 R users of diverse background to work on projects of their choice. The `learngganimate` group came about from the agglomeration of two github issues: [one](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf18/issues/11) proposed by Adam proposed by Robbie and another [one](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf18/issues/15). During the OzUnconference, the participants interested in these two projects naturally came together and comprised of seven of us:

During the whole process, Adam took charge and made it easier for us to work together. 

## What we did

The goal of learngganimate is to record the discoveries of an intrepid
group of animation explorers in the wild 🐯, amazing jungle 🌳 of the
[`gganimate` package](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate) 📦.

We aim to create documentation and share our user experience for this
amazing ⭐, yet sparsely documented, package 📦.

We collectively set our minds to the task of exploring the gganimate
package 📦.

## How was it

The result was a mixture of fun, laughter and all round goodness of `gganimate` examples that spanned from tutorials of the various transitions to fabulous queen race! How can you not love it?

The list of tutorials that continue to grow can be found [here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/learngganimate).

## What we learnt

There was nothing more fun than a giggling group of gganimaters working together to learn how `gganimate` works and sharing what you've learnt so that it will be helpful to the community. What was most fabulous (besides the queen) was the community jumping onboard to contribute. With Thomas Pedersen [announcing the launch](https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1074388077248954368) of the [documentation for `gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/), we'd like to believe that our work has been helpful to him :)
